project : 
  I'm excited to share with you a portfolio website I've built using cutting-edge technologies to showcase my 
  skills and projects. Leveraging the power of React.js, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, I've crafted a responsive and visually 
  appealing website that highlights my expertise and experience.
In addition to creating a sleek design, I've integrated features like React-icons for intuitive iconography 
getForm for seamless contact form functionality, and React-scroll for smooth scrolling navigation, enhancing the user 
experience and interactivity of the site.
